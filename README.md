**Introduction**:
Bacterial Isolates Explorer is an online tool that allows you to investigate numerous bacterial isolates. The program provides details about the bacterial strains, such as their origin, isolation, source, and antibiotic susceptibility testing results.

The project is made up of HTML, Python, and CSS that serves as the application's front-end interface. The data is saved in CSV format and retrieved with Python that helps in visualization. The project is hosted on GitHub and is accessible via a web browser.

**Files**:
•	Bifidobacterium_bifidum.html
•	Bifidobacterium_infantis.html
•	Lactobacillus_acidophilus.html
•	Lactobacillus_plantarum.html
•	Lactobacillus_reuteri.html
•	Lactobacillus_rhamnosus.html
•	Lactococcus_lactis.html
•	Streptococcus_thermophilus.html

**Installation**:
Clone the GitHub repository and open the navya.html file in a web browser to utilize the application. The program is written in HTML, CSS, and Python and requires no extra dependencies or installations of the software.

**Usage**:
After opening the application in the web browser we can select a bacterial strain from the popup menu on the screen. This will give detailed information about the bacterial strain, including its origin, isolation method, and antibiotic susceptibility. The viewers can also see the images of the strain and information about the product in which it is found.
